In the context of the [Tools for Theory](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en/tools-for-theory) event horsted by [MPI CBS Open Science](https://twitter.com/CBSOpenScience/status/1394973820553994243?s=20), Leipzig, and organized by Katarzyna Gugnowska and [Alexander Enge](https://twitter.com/alexenge), I gave a talk, titled [Tools for Theory: Improving the Theoretical Foundations of Psychology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kZfTJhXjMI&feature=emb_logo) (recorded and available on YouTube). In this blog I compile questions and answers. Some of these questions are paraphrased versions of questions received during the discussion time and some I received later on [[^1]].
